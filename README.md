# CinqueCards

Two designs for a five-suited deck of cards.

## Cinque

These cards are numbered as dozenals from 0 to 11. Ten is represented with a stylized *X* and eleven is represented with an upside-down *3*. There are five suits: clubs, diamonds, hearts, spades, and stars. There are three colors: red, blue, and purple.

### Names of Cards
In dozenal numbering, ten is named *dek* and eleven is named *el*. In some of the rules posted in the games folder, they may be referred to as **symbol cards** with a similar function as face cards.

### Colors
Red was chosen for diamaonds and hearts, similar to a standard deck of playing cards. Blue, however, was chosen in place of black so that the purple color of stars could be explained as red + blue. Also, the traditional green for a fifth suit didn't look as good in my first draft of making the cards.

## Double Cinque
Like Cinque, these cards are numbered as dozenals from 0 to 11. Again, ten is represented with a stylized *X* and eleven is represented with an upside-down *3*. There are five suits: clubs, diamonds, hearts, spades, and stars. There are five colors in double cinque: red, green, blue, purple and gold.

### Differences from Cinque
One other notable difference is that all the cards of a given suit are not the same color. This allows for games that use runs (sequences of numbers), sets (cards made up of the same suit such as hearts or stars), and matches (cards comprised of the same color).

Another minor difference is the different design for the card backs.

## Games
In the Games folder will be rules for various games. Some, like Cinque Poker, will be similar to known US card games.
